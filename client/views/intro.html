      <p>We are asking you to participate in a research study. This form is designed to give you information about this study.  We will describe this study to you and answer any of your questions.  </p>

      <h3>What the study is about</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this research is to examine the ways in which people make decisions about verbal information, and judge various items and activities.</p>

      <h3>What we will ask you to do</h3>
      <p>We will ask you to complete computer tasks in which you make judgments about words that appear on the screen and fill out short questionnaires about yourself and your opinions (total study time: about 5 minutes).</p>

      <h3>Risks and discomforts</h3>
      <p>We do not anticipate any risks of participation greater than those encountered in everyday life.  </p>

      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <p>There are no direct benefits to you for participating. Your participation may increase scientific understanding of the factors that are important in responding to words, learning events, and giving opinions on life topics.</p>

      <h3>Payment for participation</h3>
      <p>You will receive $5.00 in compensation for participation in this study.</p>

      <h3>Privacy/Confidentiality </h3>
      <p>The data we collect from you in this experiment will never be linked to your name or other personal information, and will be kept locked in a cabinet in a private lab room.  If the data from this study is published or presented in scientific journals or conferences, your personal information will never be included. Please note that although we make every effort to maintain confidentiality, it is possible that a third party could view the information. The security of information entered online or over email cannot be guaranteed.</p>

      <h3>Taking part is voluntary</h3>
      <p>Your participation is entirely voluntary.  You may refuse to participate before the study begins, discontinue at any time, or skip any questions/procedures that may make you feel uncomfortable, with no penalty to you, and no effect on the compensation earned before withdrawing, or your academic standing, record, or relationship with the university or other organization or service that may be involved with the research.</p>

      <h3>If you have questions</h3>
      <p>The main researcher conducting this study is Professor Melissa Ferguson, a faculty member at Cornell University. If you have questions, you may contact Melissa at mjf44@cornell.edu.

      <p>For the next task, you will decide as quickly as possible whether a target letter string is a real word or nonsense word.  For each judgment, two letter strings will appear sequentially: the first letter string will always be a word and will signal when the second string will appear. The first word will then be followed by the second (target) letter string. </p>
 
      <p>Your task is to decide whether the second letter string is a word or not as quickly as possible.</p>
