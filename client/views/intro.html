      <p>For the next task, you will decide as quickly as possible, whether a target letter string is a real word or nonsense word.  For each judgment, two letter strings will appear sequentially: the first letter string will always be a word and will signal when the second string will appear. The first word will then be followed by the second (target) letter string will appear. </p>
 
      <p>Your task is to decide whether the second letter string is a word or not as quickly as possible.</p>
